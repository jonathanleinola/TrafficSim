Provide short comments (2-4 sentences) for each item below.

## 1. Overall design and functionality (0-6p)

  * 1.1: The implementation corresponds to the selected topic and scope. The extent of project is large enough to accommodate work for everyone (2p)
    + In the plan, it mentions that they will fulfill all basis feature required by the course and continue to add extension features later. The work is enough for everyone. 

  * 1.2: The software structure is appropriate, clear and well documented. e.g. class structure is justified, inheritance used where appropriate, information hiding is implemented as appropriate. (2p)
    + It is good to have a diagram to illustrate the software structure. However the diagram is not explained in details. It is recommended to update the software structure during the development process.

  * 1.3: Use of external libraries is justified and well documented. (2p)
    + They plan to use Qt for the GUI and OpenStreetMap for the map data

## 2. Working practices (0-6p)

  * 2.1: Git is used appropriately (e.g., commits are logical and frequent enough, commit logs are descriptive). (2 p)
    + At the time of the review, there are 25 commits in the project repos. Part of commits is in English, and the rest is in Finnish. It is better to unify in one language. 

  * 2.2: Work is distributed and organised well. Everyone contributes to the project and has a relevant role that matches his/her skills. The distribution of roles is described well enough. (2p)
    + The works are distributed equally. The plan explains the task division quite clear and reasonable. 

  * 2.3: Quality assurance is appropriate. Implementation is tested comprehensively and those testing principles are well documented. (2p)

## 3. Implementation aspects (0-8p)

  * 3.1: Building the software is easy and well documented. CMake or such tool is highly recommended. (2p)

  * 3.2: Memory management is robust, well-organised and coherent. E.g., smart pointers are used where appropriate or RO3/5 is followed. The memory management practices should be documented. (2p)

  * 3.3: C++ standard library is used where appropriate. For example, containers are used instead of own solutions where it makes sense. (2p)

  * 3.4: Implementation works robustly also in exceptional situations. E.g., functions can survive invalid inputs and exception handling is used where appropriate. (2p)

## 4. Project extensiveness (0-10p)

  * Project contains features beyond the minimal requirements: Most of the projects list additional features which can be implemented for more points. Teams can also suggest their own custom features, though they have to be in the scope of the project and approved by the course assistant who is overseeing the project. (0-10p)

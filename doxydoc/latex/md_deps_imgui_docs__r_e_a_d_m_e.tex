Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} is a {\bfseries{bloat-\/free graphical user interface library for C++}}. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-\/pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-\/contained (no external dependencies).

Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} is designed to {\bfseries{enable fast iterations}} and to {\bfseries{empower programmers}} to create {\bfseries{content creation tools and visualization / debug tools}} (as opposed to UI for the average end-\/user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and lacks certain features normally found in more high-\/level libraries.

Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} is particularly suited to integration in games engine (for tooling), real-\/time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or any applications on consoles platforms where operating system features are non-\/standard.

{\bfseries{The core of Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} is self-\/contained within a few platform-\/agnostic files}} which you can easily copy and compile into your application/engine. They are all the files in the root folder of the repository (\mbox{\hyperlink{imgui_8cpp}{imgui.\+cpp}}, imgui.\+h, \mbox{\hyperlink{imgui__demo_8cpp}{imgui\+\_\+demo.\+cpp}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{imgui__draw_8cpp}{imgui\+\_\+draw.\+cpp}} etc.).

{\bfseries{No specific build process is required}}. You can add the .cpp files to your existing project.

You will need a backend to integrate Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} in your app. The backend passes mouse/keyboard/gamepad inputs and variety of settings to Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}}, and is in charge of rendering the resulting vertices.

{\bfseries{Backends for a variety of graphics api and rendering platforms}} are provided in the \href{https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples}{\texttt{ examples/}} folder, along with example applications. See the \href{\#integration}{\texttt{ Integration}} section of this document for details. You may also create your own backend. Anywhere where you can render textured triangles, you can render Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}}.

After Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} is setup in your application, you can use it from \+\_\+anywhere\+\_\+ in your program loop\+:

Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} allows you {\bfseries{create elaborate tools}} as well as very short-\/lived ones. On the extreme side of short-\/liveness\+: using the Edit\&Continue (hot code reload) feature of modern compilers you can add a few widgets to tweaks variables while your application is running, and remove the code a minute later! Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} is not just for tweaking values. You can use it to trace a running algorithm by just emitting text commands. You can use it along with your own reflection data to browse your dataset live. You can use it to expose the internals of a subsystem in your engine, to create a logger, an inspection tool, a profiler, a debugger, an entire game making editor/framework, etc.\hypertarget{md_deps_imgui_docs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md49}{}\doxysubsection{How it works}\label{md_deps_imgui_docs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md49}
Check out the Wiki\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki\#About-the-IMGUI-paradigm}{\texttt{ About the I\+M\+G\+UI paradigm}} section if you want to understand the core principles behind the I\+M\+G\+UI paradigm. An I\+M\+G\+UI tries to minimize superfluous state duplication, state synchronization and state retention from the user\textquotesingle{}s point of view. It is less error prone (less code and less bugs) than traditional retained-\/mode interfaces, and lends itself to create dynamic user interfaces.

Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} outputs vertex buffers and command lists that you can easily render in your application. The number of draw calls and state changes required to render them is fairly small. Because Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} doesn\textquotesingle{}t know or touch graphics state directly, you can call its functions anywhere in your code (e.\+g. in the middle of a running algorithm, or in the middle of your own rendering process). Refer to the sample applications in the examples/ folder for instructions on how to integrate dear imgui with your existing codebase.

{\itshape A common misunderstanding is to mistake immediate mode gui for immediate mode rendering, which usually implies hammering your driver/\+G\+PU with a bunch of inefficient draw calls and state changes as the gui functions are called. This is N\+OT what Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} does. Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} outputs vertex buffers and a small list of draw calls batches. It never touches your G\+PU directly. The draw call batches are decently optimal and you can render them later, in your app or even remotely.}\hypertarget{md_deps_imgui_docs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md50}{}\doxysubsection{Demo}\label{md_deps_imgui_docs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md50}
Calling the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui_af95643a0ce4893b9e57c12991922fb18}{Im\+Gui\+::\+Show\+Demo\+Window()}}} function will create a demo window showcasing variety of features and examples. The code is always available for reference in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{imgui__demo_8cpp}{imgui\+\_\+demo.\+cpp}}}.



You should be able to build the examples from sources (tested on Windows/\+Mac/\+Linux). If you don\textquotesingle{}t, let me know! If you want to have a quick look at some Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} features, you can download Windows binaries of the demo app here\+:

\end{DoxyItemize}

The demo applications are not D\+PI aware so expect some blurriness on a 4K screen. For D\+PI awareness in your application, you can load/reload your font at different scale, and scale your style with {\ttfamily style.\+Scale\+All\+Sizes()}.\hypertarget{md_deps_imgui_docs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md51}{}\doxysubsection{Integration}\label{md_deps_imgui_docs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md51}
On most platforms and when using C++, {\bfseries{you should be able to use a combination of the \href{https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples}{\texttt{ imgui\+\_\+impl\+\_\+xxxx}} files without modification}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{imgui__impl__win32_8cpp}{imgui\+\_\+impl\+\_\+win32.\+cpp}}} + {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{imgui__impl__dx11_8cpp}{imgui\+\_\+impl\+\_\+dx11.\+cpp}}}). If your engine supports multiple platforms, consider using more of the imgui\+\_\+impl\+\_\+xxxx files instead of rewriting them\+: this will be less work for you and you can get Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} running immediately. You can {\itshape later} decide to rewrite a custom binding using your custom engine functions if you wish so.

Integrating Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} within your custom engine is a matter of 1) wiring mouse/keyboard/gamepad inputs 2) uploading one texture to your G\+P\+U/render engine 3) providing a render function that can bind textures and render textured triangles. The \href{https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples}{\texttt{ examples/}} folder is populated with applications doing just that. If you are an experienced programmer at ease with those concepts, it should take you less than two hours to integrate Dear \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_im_gui}{Im\+Gui}} in your custom engine. {\bfseries{Make sure to spend time reading the \href{https://www.dearimgui.org/faq}{\texttt{ F\+AQ}}, comments, and some of the examples/ application!}}

{\bfseries{Which version should I get?}}

I occasionally tag \href{https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases}{\texttt{ Releases}} but it is generally safe and recommended to sync to master/latest. The library is fairly stable and regressions tend to be fixed fast when reported.

You may also peak at the \href{https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/1542}{\texttt{ Multi-\/\+Viewport}} and \href{https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/2109}{\texttt{ Docking}} features in the {\ttfamily docking} branch.

Developed by \href{http://www.miracleworld.net}{\texttt{ Omar Cornut}} and every direct or indirect contributors to the Git\+Hub. The early version of this library was developed with the support of \href{http://www.mediamolecule.com}{\texttt{ Media Molecule}} and first used internally on the game \href{http://tearaway.mediamolecule.com}{\texttt{ Tearaway}} (Vita).

I first discovered the I\+M\+G\+UI paradigm at \href{http://www.q-games.com}{\texttt{ Q-\/\+Games}} where Atman Binstock had dropped his own simple implementation in the codebase, which I spent quite some time improving and thinking about. It turned out that Atman was exposed to the concept directly by working with Casey. When I moved to Media Molecule I rewrote a new library trying to overcome the flaws and limitations of the first one I\textquotesingle{}ve worked with. It became this library and since then I have spent an unreasonable amount of time iterating and improving it.
